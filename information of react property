this is my notes app in which i use two way binding(onChange,value) and props
i want to make another project like todo list i think in this i use react hook form (register, handlesubmit , reset , formstate :error) in place of two way binding and i use context Api in place of props 
becouse props move the data only from parent to child but context move the data from parent to grand child or grand grand grand child...
